### Hi, I'm Snider ðŸ‘‹

I spend my time working on tools to keep people safe from the internet; For the past year I have been designing a safer network.

Thing is, people dont look at problems abstractly enough, the bigger picture.

Lethean's DAO is now a player in Web3 as a service network, with Confidential Payments, 70+ gTLD's and a community run Transit network to come. 

I have a plan, a crazy network interlay with the 3 char gTLD's to map the IPv4/IPv6 address space, into a privacy net where data owners can make routing choices based on threat conditions of their zone.

It's hard to explain in words, makes my head hurt, come back later when its coded.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on https://lt.hn | [Lethean Workstation](https://github.com/letheanVPN/Workstation#readme)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on good ideas.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: snider@lt.hn
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can click my tongue on the top of my mouth so loud, it always echoes.
