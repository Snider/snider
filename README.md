### Hi, I'm Snider ðŸ‘‹

I'm spending my time working on tools to keep people safe from the internet; I have been designing a safer network for the past year.

The thing is, people don't look at problems abstractly enough, the bigger picture.

Lethean's DAO is now a player in Web3 as a service network, with Confidential Payments, 70+ gTLD's and a community-run Transit network to come. 

I have a plan; a crazy network with interlays mapping the IPv4/IPv6 address space into a privacy net; that can alter the OSI Layer flow mid-flight where data owners can make routing choices based on threat conditions of their zone.

It's hard to explain in words; it makes my head hurt; come back later when I can show you things.

Why do I own these? id.pgp, private.pgp, public.pgp, wallet.pgp

Why, Why, Why? 

Whatever commercial world, Thank you from the Open Source Community for being crap at social responsibility, OpenPGP dks... on the way.
