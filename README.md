Hi there, I’m Snider 👋

I’m an autistic self-taught developer with over 20 years of experience in distributed technology, commerce, and B2B Whitelabel SaaS.

Currently, I’m working on open-source tools to protect people under the Copyleft EUPL-1.2 Public Licence (OSS that can be used in commercial, research, or patent applications).

- I’m currently developing a Web3 framework for both business and personal use.
- You can reach me at my email address.
- Fun fact: I can click my tongue on the top of my mouth so loudly that it always echoes.
- My favourite book is “As a Man Thinketh” by James Allen (1902). You can find it here: [As a Man Thinketh - James Allen 1902](https://james-allen.in1woord.nl/?text=as-a-man-thinketh)
