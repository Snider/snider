### Hi, I'm Snider 👋

I'm spending my time working on tools to keep people safe from the internet; I have been designing a safer network for the past year.

During my research, I made a list of [Recommend Services](https://github.com/Snider/security-research/tree/main/good-companies), Companies that are friendly to our industory.

People don't look at problems abstractly enough, the bigger picture.

I have a plan; a crazy network, OSI-9 with interlays mapping the IPv4/IPv6 address space into Web3; this interlacing tech can alter the OSI Layer flow mid-flight where data owners can make routing choices based on threat conditions of their zone.

It's hard to explain in words; it makes my head hurt; come back later when I can show you things.

Why do I own these?* id.pgp, private.pgp, public.pgp, wallet.pgp

Not a dig at my domain registrar; just every security professional who knew about the tld and did nothing; Who is watching out for us? thought someone was...

Why, Why, Why? 

Whatever commercial world, Thank you from the Open Source Community for being crap at social responsibility, OpenPGP dks... on the way.

Looking for Bears to HLOD their BTC/LTC for a little bit in LTHN too :)
